## v0.9.0 (2025-09-24 19:30:00) ‚Äî MVP System Stabilization

### üîß **Critical Fixes & Functionality**

- **[FIX] Apply button functionality** - Added missing handleApplyClick function
  - Root cause: `window.handleApplyClick is not a function` error
  - Solution: Created MVP version of handleApplyClick in date-range-picker.js
  - Result: Apply button now processes clicks and fetches data successfully

- **[FIX] Enterprise start_date integration** - Proper initialization from config
  - Added `window.ENTERPRISE_START_DATE` to reports page JavaScript variables
  - Updated date-range-picker.js to use enterprise start_date for initialization
  - Default behavior: Start date = enterprise start_date, End date = today

- **[FIX] "All" preset selection** - Correctly selected when page loads with enterprise dates
  - Updated initialization logic to select "All" preset when enterprise start_date is available
  - "All" preset now represents custom date range from enterprise start to today
  - Fixed "All" preset functionality to populate enterprise start_date to today

- **[FIX] "None" preset clearing** - Properly clears date fields when selected
  - Updated event listener to call clearDateRange() when "None" is selected
  - "None" preset now properly clears both start and end date fields
  - Button states update correctly

- **[TEST] Chrome MCP validation** - All preset buttons working correctly
  - "Today" preset: Sets both dates to current date ‚úÖ
  - "Past Month" preset: Sets previous month date range ‚úÖ
  - "All" preset: Sets enterprise start_date to today ‚úÖ
  - "None" preset: Clears both date fields ‚úÖ

- **[PERF] Date range picker** - Full functionality with enterprise config integration
  - Enterprise start_date ("08-06-22" for CCC) properly initialized
  - Today's date ("09-24-25") properly set as end date
  - Active Date Range display working correctly
  - All preset ranges functional
