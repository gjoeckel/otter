# Options to Address Broken Functionality

Please choose one of the following options to proceed:

1.  **Revert all local changes on `reports-fixes` and pull from `master`**: This will discard all uncommitted changes on your current branch (`reports-fixes`) and then update your local `reports-fixes` branch to match the `master` branch from the remote. This is a good option if you want to quickly get back to a known working state.

2.  **Stash current changes on `reports-fixes`, switch to `master`, and then create a new branch to investigate the issue**: This will temporarily save your current uncommitted changes, allow you to switch to the `master` branch (which is presumed to be stable), and then create a new branch from `master` to begin debugging or re-implementing the features. This is a good option if you want to preserve your current work but start fresh on a stable base.

3.  **Review the current changes on `reports-fixes` to identify and fix the breaking changes**: This involves going through the modified files on your current `reports-fixes` branch to pinpoint what caused the breakage and then fixing it directly. This is a good option if you believe the breaking changes are minor and can be quickly identified and resolved within the current branch.

# Next Steps for Investigation (on `investigate-broken-functionality` branch)

Now that we are on a clean branch based on the latest `master`, we can proceed with diagnosing the broken functionality. Please choose one of the following options:

1.  **Start the local development server and manually test the application**: This involves running the PHP built-in server and navigating through the application in a browser to identify which parts are broken and how they are failing. This is a good initial step for understanding the scope of the problem.

2.  **Run the existing test suite**: This involves executing the project's automated tests to pinpoint specific failing tests. This can quickly identify areas of regression and provide more detailed error messages.

3.  **Review the recent changes on the `master` branch**: This involves examining the commit history on the `master` branch to see if any recent changes might have introduced the breakage. This can be useful if the problem is suspected to be a new regression from a recent merge.
