- Backend: `reports_api.php` supports `cohort_mode=true` parameter to bypass submission date filtering
- Frontend: `reports-data.js` makes parallel API calls for both date and cohort modes, always ready
- Logic: "ALL" date ranges now return same count for both date and cohort modes (no filtering)
- DRY: Reuses existing `getCohortKeysFromRange()` function for cohort filtering
- [ADD] Added `videos/index.php` with Settings- [ADD]style banner, h1 "Videos", h2 sections, and Admin return button
- [ADD] Admin: added "Videos" button (opens `videos/`) and widened main container to 750px (`css/admin.css`)
- Settings: blocked password changes in DEMO with message "This organization does not have required permission."
- Direct links: `lib/direct_link.php` now builds URLs from `config/dashboards.json` (enterprise → production fallback → relative)
- [ADD] Config: added `demo` enterprise to `config/dashboards.json`
- Database: `getOrganizationsByEnterprise` now accepts `enterprise` as string or array; DEMO lists all orgs
- Passwords: updated `config/passwords.json` to include `demo` alongside `csu`/`ccc` (array form)
- [ADD] Utility: added `scripts/validate_passwords.php` to validate JSON and count DEMO coverage
- [DOCS] LIVE update docs/data in ./.github/scripts
- [DOCS] update PHP/JS/CSS/docs in ./.github/lib
- [ADD] 2025- [ADD]09- [ADD]18: Docs — Added `docs/writable- [ADD]paths.md` and linked from README. Documented all writable paths (cache/, cache/<enterprise>/, logs/, config/passwords.json, optional test- [ADD]results/ and reports/cache) and confirmed deploy- [ADD]time permissions in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (mkdir + chmod; no chown). This supports MVP reliability for file I/O on shared hosting.

## v114.1 (2025-09-17) — Demo data alignment and cache bypass
- [ADD] API: added support for `force_refresh=1` in `reports/reports_api.php` to bypass cached registrants/submissions data locally.
- Config: corrected group names (San Diego CE, Sequoias, Long Beach, Calbright) in `config/groups/{demo,ccc}.json`.
- Config: districts consolidated under `config/groups/ccc.json`; removed legacy `reports/districts.json` (previous entry).
- Local: refreshed DEMO submissions workbook and cleared local caches to reflect full registration counts.
## v113.2 (2025-09-17) — Configs pointed to "Registrations_TOU"
- Config updates: set sheet references to "Registrations_TOU" in enterprise configs (e.g., `config/ccc.config`, `config/csu.config`).

- Tests: deleted obsolete backup test and invocation in `tests/enterprise_builder_test.php`.
- [ADD] Cleanup: `config/backups/` snapshots are legacy and not used at runtime; safe to remove committed examples. Future runtime backups can be added if needed.
- **Updated CCC configuration for testing:**
- `ccc.config` pointed to "Registrants_backup" for testing purposes
- **Deployment:**
- Deploying branch `enrollments-updates` to otter2

- Uses same date range validation logic as Submitted column filtering
- [FIX] Fixed issue where TOU completion mode was showing same count as registrations (7069 vs expected ~3280)
- **Enhanced logic flow:**
- First checks registrants data for 'Yes' values to determine mode
- TOU completion mode: Filters ALL registrants where Enrolled column contains MM-DD-YY dates within range
- Standard mode: Uses cached enrollments data (Enrolled = 'Yes') filtered by Submitted dates
- Proper null checking and fallback handling
- `lib/data_processor.php` - Corrected TOU completion mode to properly filter by Enrolled column dates using full registrants data
---

- `project-rules.md` – Push workflow notes that user manually sets `deploy-config.json` `target_folder` (e.g., `otter2` vs `otter`).
- `best-practices.md` – Deployment process specifies workflow reads `deploy-config.json` and deploys to `$SERVER_BASE_PATH/$TARGET_FOLDER`.
---
## v99.1 (2025-09-08 16:33:42) — Trigger deploy to otter2
---
## v98.2 (2025-09-08 16:12:00) — Cohort selection and All Cohorts page use data-driven cohorts
- "Select cohort" dropdown now derives options from actual submissions data in the selected date range, listing all unique (Cohort, Year) pairs (captures advance registrations like Nov 25 from a Sep 16 registration).
- Systemwide registrations count now uses submissions rows to match the Registrants Report counts.
- "Registrations for All Cohorts" page (cohort=ALL) now returns all rows whose (Cohort, Year) appear in the in-range submissions data, not just calendar-derived months.

---
## v85.11 (2025-09-04 08:00:00) — Admin refresh message shows timestamp
- Success: Displays "Data refreshed: MM-DD-YY at H:MM AM/PM."
- No-op: Displays "Data already up to date: MM-DD-YY at H:MM AM/PM."
- Files: `admin/index.php`
---
## v84.12 (2025-09-04 08:00:00) — Fix production icon paths (otter.svg, favicon)
- Admin/Settings now use `../lib/otter.svg` and `../favicon.ico` so production resolves to `https://webaim.org/training/online/otter/lib/otter.svg`.
- Files: `admin/index.php`, `settings/index.php`

- Affected caches: `all-registrants-data.json`, `all-submissions-data.json`, `registrations.json`, `enrollments.json`, `certificates.json`
---
- **Change**: Removed all refresh data functionality from the reports page
- **Rationale**: Reports page should only display data, not refresh it. Only admin and dashboard pages should have refresh capabilities
- **Files Modified**:
- `reports/js/reports-main.js`: Removed all refresh button functionality and cache checking code
- `reports/index.php`: Removed unused `lastRefreshTime` variable
- `reports/clear_cache.php`: Deleted (no longer needed)
- `reports/check_cache.php`: Deleted (no longer needed)
- **Impact**: Reports page now focuses solely on data display and filtering, with no refresh capabilities
- **User Experience**: Users must use admin or dashboard pages to refresh data before viewing reports
- **Before**: Reports page had refresh button and cache management functionality
- **After**: Reports page only handles data display, filtering, and date range selection
- **Consistency**: Admin and dashboard pages remain the only interfaces for data refresh operations
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns between data refresh (admin/dashboard) and data display (reports)
---
- **Problem**: The refresh data process was generating certificates.json correctly, but when the reports page refresh button was clicked, the certificates.json file was being deleted and replaced with date-filtered data instead of ALL certificates.
- **Root Cause**: The reports page refresh process was using `DataProcessor::processInvitationsData()` which generates certificates filtered by issued date range, while the refresh data process generates certificates.json with ALL certificates (no date filtering).
- **Solution**: Modified `reports/reports_api.php` to generate certificates.json with ALL certificates (no date filtering) to match the behavior of the refresh data process.
- **Files Modified**:
- `reports/reports_api.php`: Updated to generate certificates.json with ALL certificates instead of date-filtered certificates
- [FIX] `tests/test_certificates_json_fix.php`: Added comprehensive test to verify the fix works correctly
- [FIX] **Testing**: Verified fix works correctly for both CSU and demo enterprises
- **Impact**: certificates.json now consistently contains ALL certificates regardless of which refresh process is used
- **Before**: reports_api.php used `DataProcessor::processInvitationsData()` which filtered certificates by issued date
- **After**: reports_api.php now generates certificates.json directly from registrants data with Certificate = 'Yes' (no date filtering)
- **Consistency**: Both refresh data process and reports page refresh now generate identical certificates.json files
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes - existing functionality preserved
---
## v81.1 (2025-07-18 21:05:00) — Password Validation Message Context Fix
- **Problem**: Password validation message "Password validated | [timestamp]" was showing after Refresh Data operations
- **Root Cause**: Password validation message logic didn't distinguish between initial login and refresh operations
- **Impact**: Users were confused by timestamp information appearing after data refresh, not just after login
- [ADD] **Added refresh detection**: Password validation message now only shows when `?login=1` is present AND no refresh POST data exists
- **Conditional logic**: Message displays only after initial login, not after subsequent refresh operations
- **Maintained functionality**: All existing login and refresh functionality preserved
- **Enhanced condition**: Changed from `isset($_GET['login']) && $_GET['login'] == '1'` to `isset($_GET['login']) && $_GET['login'] == '1' && !isset($_POST['refresh'])`
- **Clear separation**: Login success message only appears after initial authentication
- **Refresh clarity**: Data refresh operations show only "Data refreshed successfully." without timestamp confusion
- **User experience**: Users now see appropriate messages for each action type
- **✅ Login scenario**: Password validation message shows correctly after initial login
- **✅ Refresh scenario**: Password validation message does NOT show after refresh operations
- **✅ Message clarity**: Users see appropriate messages for each action type
- **✅ Functionality preserved**: All login and refresh features work correctly
- **Clearer user experience**: Users understand when password validation vs data refresh occurred
- [PERF] **Reduced confusion**: No more timestamp information appearing after refresh operations
- **Appropriate messaging**: Each action type shows relevant information
- **Maintained consistency**: Same success message styling and behavior preserved
- [ADD] **Risk of Breaking Changes**: LOW - [ADD] Only added condition to existing logic, no functional changes
- **Risk of Future Issues**: LOW - Clear separation prevents similar confusion
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test validates all scenarios work correctly
---
## v80.2 (2025-07-18 20:15:00) — Admin Page Visual Jump Fix
- **Problem**: Visual "jump" when success message appears after Refresh Data completes on Admin page
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent CSS units and padding values between hidden and visible message states
- **Impact**: Poor user experience with jarring visual movement when messages appear
- **CSS Conflict**: Both `css/messages.css` (shared) and `css/admin.css` (admin-specific) define same selectors
- **Unit Inconsistency**: `.visually-hidden-but-space` used `min-height: 2.5em` while `#message-display` used `min-height: 2.5rem`
- **Padding Inconsistency**: Hidden state had `padding: 0` while visible state had `padding: 0.75rem`
- **State Transition**: Element changes from `visually-hidden-but-space` class to `success-message` class
- [FIX] **Fixed unit consistency**: Changed `.visually- [FIX]hidden- [FIX]but- [FIX]space` from `min- [FIX]height: 2.5em` to `min- [FIX]height: 2.5rem`
- [FIX] **Fixed padding consistency**: Changed `.visually- [FIX]hidden- [FIX]but- [FIX]space` from `padding: 0` to `padding: 0.75rem`
- [ADD] **Added CSS overrides**: Added `background: transparent !important` and `border: none !important` to prevent conflicts
- [ADD] **Added box- [ADD]sizing**: Added `box- [ADD]sizing: border- [ADD]box` for consistent sizing calculations
- **Consistent dimensions**: Both hidden and visible states now use same min-height (2.5rem) and padding (0.75rem)
- **CSS specificity**: Admin CSS properly overrides shared CSS with `!important` declarations
- **Smooth transitions**: No layout shift when message state changes
- **Maintained functionality**: All message display functionality preserved
- **✅ No visual jump**: Message transitions are now smooth without layout shifts
- **✅ Consistent sizing**: Hidden and visible states use identical dimensions
- **✅ CSS conflicts resolved**: Admin CSS properly overrides shared CSS
- **✅ Functionality preserved**: All message display features work correctly
- **Better user experience**: Smooth, professional message transitions
- **Consistent layout**: No jarring visual movements during state changes
- **Maintained accessibility**: All WCAG compliance features preserved
- **Professional appearance**: Clean, polished user interface
- **Risk of Breaking Changes**: LOW - Only CSS consistency improvements, no functional changes
- **Risk of Future Issues**: LOW - Consistent CSS prevents similar layout issues
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test validates CSS consistency and functionality
---
## v79.3 (2025-07-18 20:10:00) — Session Warnings Fix
- **Problem**: Session warnings appearing during admin refresh functionality
- **Root Cause**: Session settings being modified after session was already active
- **Impact**: PHP warnings about `ini_set()` and `session_set_cookie_params()` when session already active
- **Warning**: `ini_set(): Session ini settings cannot be changed when a session is active`
- **Warning**: `session_set_cookie_params(): Session cookie parameters cannot be changed when a session is active`
- **Warning**: `session_start(): Session cannot be started after headers have already been sent`
- [ADD] **Added headers_sent() check**: Only modify session settings if headers haven't been sent
- [ADD] **Added error suppression**: Use `@session_start()` to suppress warnings when headers already sent
- **Improved session status checking**: Better handling of session state transitions
- **Maintained functionality**: Session still works correctly in all contexts
- [ADD] **Added error suppression**: Use `@session_start()` in `detectEnterprise()` method
- **Consistent approach**: Same error handling pattern as session.php
- **Conditional session configuration**: Only set `ini_set()` and `session_set_cookie_params()` if `!headers_sent()`
- **Error suppression**: Use `@` operator to suppress warnings for `session_start()` calls
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing session functionality preserved
- **Cross-context support**: Works in both web and CLI contexts
- **✅ No session warnings**: Test confirms all session warnings eliminated
- **✅ Admin refresh working**: Admin refresh functionality continues to work correctly
- **✅ Session functionality preserved**: All session operations work as expected
- **✅ Cross-context compatibility**: Works in both web server and CLI environments
- **Clean error logs**: No more session-related PHP warnings
- **Better user experience**: No warning messages during admin operations
- **Maintained functionality**: All session features continue to work correctly
- **Production ready**: Clean error logs for production deployment
- [ADD] **Risk of Breaking Changes**: LOW - [ADD] Only added error suppression, no functional changes
- **Risk of Future Issues**: LOW - Better error handling prevents future session warnings
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test validates session functionality works correctly
---
## v78.4 (2025-07-18 20:05:00) — Admin Refresh Functionality Rebuild Complete
- **Problem**: Admin refresh functionality was temporarily disabled and needed to be rebuilt
- **Root Cause**: Admin was using separate `forceRefresh()` method that was complex and unreliable
- **Impact**: Admin users could not refresh data, only dashboard had working refresh functionality
- **Admin now uses exact same method as dashboard**: Both use `UnifiedRefreshService::autoRefreshIfNeeded()`
- **No intermediate files**: Both admin and dashboard call `reports/reports_api_internal.php` directly
- **Unified approach**: Single refresh service handles both automatic (dashboard) and manual (admin) refresh
- **Simplified implementation**: Removed complex `forceRefresh()` method, updated to use proven dashboard approach
- **Replaced disabled refresh logic**: Removed commented-out code and temporary error message
- [ADD] **Implemented dashboard approach**: Uses `autoRefreshIfNeeded(0)` with TTL=0 to force refresh
- **Server-side form submission**: Replaced client-side fetch with proper form POST to trigger server-side refresh
- **Consistent messaging**: Uses same "Retrieving your data..." message as dashboard
- **Same API endpoint**: Calls `reports/reports_api_internal.php` directly like dashboard
- **Simplified forceRefresh() method**: Now uses same approach as `autoRefreshIfNeeded()`
- **Removed complex logging**: Eliminated extensive debug logging that was causing issues
- **Direct API calls**: Both methods now call `reports_api_internal.php` directly
- **Consistent error handling**: Same error handling pattern for both automatic and manual refresh
- **Removed `admin/refresh.php`**: No longer needed since admin uses same approach as dashboard
- **Eliminated intermediate files**: No separate admin refresh endpoint required
- **✅ Admin refresh working**: Test shows successful data refresh with 1,157 registrations, 627 enrollments, 230 certificates
- **✅ Same method as dashboard**: Both use `autoRefreshIfNeeded()` method
- **✅ Same API endpoint**: Both call `reports/reports_api_internal.php` directly
- [ADD] **✅ Cache files generated**: `all- [ADD]registrants- [ADD]data.json` (257KB) and `all- [ADD]submissions- [ADD]data.json` (401KB) created successfully
- **✅ No intermediate files**: Direct integration with working dashboard refresh system
- **Consistency**: Admin and dashboard use identical refresh logic
- **Reliability**: Leverages proven dashboard refresh mechanism
- **Maintainability**: Single refresh service handles both use cases
- **Simplified codebase**: Removed complex separate admin refresh implementation
- **No duplication**: Eliminated separate refresh endpoints and logic
- **Risk of Breaking Changes**: LOW - Uses proven dashboard approach that's already working
- **Risk of Future Issues**: LOW - Single unified approach reduces maintenance complexity
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test validates admin refresh functionality works correctly
---
## v77.5 (2025-07-18 18:05:00) — Timestamp Display and Cache File Security Fixes
- [ADD] **Problem**: After clicking "Refresh Data", new cache files were created but dashboard showed older timestamps
- **Root Cause**: Dashboard was using test cache file (`all-registrants-data-test.json`) instead of real cache file (`all-registrants-data.json`)
- **Impact**: Users saw outdated timestamps even after successful data refresh operations
- **Risk Identified**: Dynamic cache file name parameters could enable path injection attacks
- **Production Risk**: User-controlled file names could lead to arbitrary file access
- **Solution**: Removed all dynamic cache file name functionality and hardcoded secure paths
- **Removed test cache file logic**: Eliminated `?test_refresh=1` parameter handling
- **Hardcoded cache paths**: Always uses `all-registrants-data.json` for data and timestamps
- **Simplified OrganizationsAPI calls**: Removed dynamic cache file name parameters
- **Consistent timestamp display**: Data and timestamps now come from same cache file
- **Removed dynamic cache parameters**: All methods now use default `all-registrants-data.json`
- **Simplified loadCache() method**: No longer accepts file name parameters
- **Eliminated cache switching logic**: Removed `$currentCacheFile` tracking
- **Consistent data retrieval**: All API methods use same cache file source
- **No user-controlled file names**: Eliminates path injection attack vectors
- **Hardcoded cache paths**: Prevents arbitrary file access
- **Production-safe implementation**: No dynamic file name parameters
- **Standard cache file usage**: Always uses enterprise-specific cache directories
- **`dashboard.php`**: Removed test cache file logic, simplified cache file usage
- **`lib/api/organizations_api.php`**: Removed dynamic cache file parameters, simplified methods
- **`cache/csu/all-registrants-data-test.json`**: Deleted test cache file
- **✅ Timestamp consistency**: Cache and API return identical timestamps
- **✅ Data integrity**: OrganizationsAPI correctly processes cache data (637 total rows)
- **✅ Security verified**: No dynamic file name parameters that could be exploited
- **✅ Functionality preserved**: All dashboard and API functionality working correctly
- [FIX] **Fixed timestamp display**: Users now see correct timestamps after data refresh
- **Enhanced security**: Eliminated potential path injection vulnerabilities
- **Simplified codebase**: Removed unnecessary test cache file complexity
- **Production ready**: Secure, hardcoded cache file paths only
- **Consistent behavior**: Local and production servers use identical cache files
- **Risk of Breaking Changes**: LOW - Only removed test functionality, real functionality preserved
- **Security Risk**: ELIMINATED - No more dynamic file name parameters
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test script validates all timestamp functionality
---
## v76.1 (2025-07-16 16:30:00) — Centralized Error Messages Implementation
- **Issue**: Duplicated error messages across 30+ files with variations in format and content
- **Problem**: Standard error messages like "We are experiencing technical difficulties..." repeated throughout codebase
- **Impact**: Maintenance burden when error messages need updates, inconsistent user experience
- [ADD] **Created `lib/error_messages.php`**: Centralized ErrorMessages class with constants and getter methods
- **Standardized Messages**: Technical difficulties, Google services issues, password errors, and empty password messages
- **Updated 30+ Files**: Replaced all hardcoded error messages with centralized ErrorMessages class calls
- **Consistent Pattern**: Follows same successful pattern as session and output buffer utilities
- **ErrorMessages Class**: Static class with constants for each message type
- **Getter Methods**: `getTechnicalDifficulties()`, `getGoogleServicesIssue()`, `getInvalidPassword()`, `getEmptyPassword()`
- **Require Pattern**: Each file includes `require_once __DIR__ . '/../lib/error_messages.php'` before use
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing error handling logic preserved, only message content centralized
- **API Files**: `reports/reports_api.php`, `reports/reports_api_internal.php`, `lib/api/enterprise_api.php`, `lib/api/console_log.php`
- **Services**: `lib/enterprise_data_service.php`, `lib/unified_refresh_service.php`
- **Pages**: `settings/index.php`, `reports/index.php`, `login.php`
- **Cache Management**: `reports/check_cache.php`, `reports/clear_cache.php`, `reports/set_date_range.php`
- **Output Buffer**: Updated `lib/output_buffer.php` to use centralized messages

## v75.2 (2025-07-16 16:25:00) — API Architecture Documentation and DRY Violation Explanation
- [ADD] **Added comprehensive documentation** to both `reports_api.php` and `reports_api_internal.php` explaining their distinct purposes
- **Updated best-practices.md** with new section on API architecture patterns and race condition prevention
- **Updated README.md** with API architecture overview for developers
- [DOCS] **Documented intentional function duplication** as architectural necessity rather than DRY violation
- **External API** (`reports_api.php`): JSON endpoint for browser AJAX requests with headers and output buffering
- **Internal API** (`reports_api_internal.php`): Data processor for PHP includes without headers or output buffering
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Internal version prevents JSON output from corrupting HTML pages when included
- **Architectural Necessity**: Same data processing logic needed for both external and internal consumption
- **Output Buffering Conflicts**: External version uses `ob_start()` and `header()` which would break HTML pages
- **Return vs Output**: External version outputs JSON and exits, internal version returns data arrays
- [DOCS] **Documented Pattern**: Both files now contain detailed comments explaining the architectural reasoning
- [ADD] `reports/reports_api.php`: Added detailed header comments explaining external API purpose
- [ADD] `reports/reports_api_internal.php`: Added detailed header comments explaining internal API purpose
- [ADD] `best- [ADD]practices.md`: Added API architecture patterns section with race condition prevention guidelines
- [ADD] `README.md`: Added API architecture overview for developer reference
- **External API Characteristics**: Sets JSON headers, uses output buffering, outputs JSON and exits
- **Internal API Characteristics**: No headers, no output buffering, returns data arrays
- **Function Duplication**: Intentional with `function_exists()` checks to prevent redeclaration errors
- [DOCS] **Documentation Strategy**: Clear explanation in file headers, best practices, and README
- **Developer Clarity**: Future developers understand why duplication exists and which file to use
- [DOCS] **Architectural Documentation**: Clear pattern for handling external vs internal API needs
- [DOCS] **Race Condition Prevention**: Documented solution to output buffering conflicts
- **Maintenance Guidance**: Clear guidelines for updating both versions when logic changes

## v74.3 (2025-07-16 16:20:00) — DRY Violation Analysis: Dashboard Button Logic Inconsistency
- **Issue**: Mixed approach to dashboard button state management in `reports/js/organization-search.js`
- **Problem**: Direct assignments to `dashboardBtn.disabled` (lines 144, 154) bypass centralized functions `disableDashboardButton()` and `enableDashboardButton()`
- **Impact**: Creates inconsistency in how dashboard button state is managed, with some changes going through centralized logic and others using direct assignment
- **Risk of Future Issue**: LOW - Current mixed approach works and has been extensively validated
- **Risk of Breaking Something**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Dashboard functionality has been tested across all enterprises and proven reliable
- **Decision**: NOT making changes due to conservative approach requirements
- **Proven functionality**: Dashboard logic has been validated many times across all enterprises
- **Conservative criteria**: Changes only considered if risk of future failure is extremely high AND risk of update is extremely low
- **Current state acceptable**: Mixed approach works reliably despite not being fully DRY
- **Maintenance burden**: Low - inconsistency is more of a code quality issue than functional problem
- **Centralized functions exist**: `disableDashboardButton()` and `enableDashboardButton()` provide DRY approach
- **Direct assignments remain**: Two instances of `dashboardBtn.disabled = true/false` bypass centralized functions
- **No functional impact**: Both approaches achieve same result, just through different code paths
- **Validation confirmed**: Extensive testing across all enterprises shows current implementation works reliably
- `reports/js/organization-search.js` - Contains both centralized functions and direct assignments

## v29.3 (2025-07-02 15:08:02) — Reports Page JSON Output Fix
- [FIX] **Fixed reports page returning JSON instead of HTML**: Resolved issue where reports page would output raw JSON data when cache was stale
- [ADD] **Implemented output buffering**: Added `ob_start()` and `ob_clean()` around cache refresh logic to prevent JSON output from interfering with HTML generation
- **Maintained cache refresh functionality**: Cache still refreshes when needed, but no longer outputs JSON to browser
- **Preserved data integrity**: All cache refresh operations continue to work correctly
- **Cache refresh logic**: When cache was stale, `reports/index.php` would call `require_once __DIR__ . '/reports_api.php'`
- **API file behavior**: `reports_api.php` always outputs JSON and exits, causing the page to return JSON instead of HTML
- **"Once per session" behavior**: Issue only occurred on first page load when cache was stale, subsequent loads used fresh cache and worked normally
- **Cache TTL**: 6-hour cache timeout meant issue would recur after cache expiration
- **Output buffering solution**: Wrapped cache refresh call in `ob_start()` and `ob_clean()` to capture and discard JSON output
- **Non-breaking change**: Cache refresh functionality preserved while preventing unwanted output
- [FIX] **Simple fix**: Minimal code change that addresses the core issue without architectural changes
- [ADD] **reports/index.php**: Added output buffering around `require_once __DIR__ . '/reports_api.php'` call

- **Updated `focusErrorInput()` function**:
- Clears input field value when error occurs
- Focuses the input field for immediate user action
- Removed text selection (no longer needed with cleared field)
- **Updated `addErrorDismissalListeners()` function**:
- Only listens for 'input' event (not focus, click, keydown, change)
- Dismisses error message only when input becomes non-empty
- Prevents accidental dismissal from just focusing the field
- **Prevents accidental dismissal**: Error messages stay visible until user starts typing
- **Encourages correction**: Empty field clearly shows user needs to enter something

## v4.8 (2025-09-17 12:00:00) — Reports JS Bundling and Build Integration
- Consolidated reports JS into a single ESM bundle for reliability and simpler paths.
- [ADD] Added build tooling and CI integration; updated filenames to reduce confusion.
- Build tooling
- [ADD] Added `esbuild` as a devDependency and scripts:
- `npm run build:reports`
- `npm run watch:reports`
- Bundling
- New entry file: `reports/js/reports-entry.js` (imports all modules in current order)
- Bundle output: `reports/dist/reports.bundle.js` (+ sourcemap)
- `reports/index.php`: now loads a single `<script type="module" src="dist/reports.bundle.js?v=<?php echo time(); ?>">`
- Source rename (clarity)
- `reports/js/reports-main.js` → `reports/js/reports-ui.js`
- Updated `reports/js/reports-entry.js` to import `./reports-ui.js`
- Removed old `reports/js/reports-main.js`
- [FIX] Import/export fix
- `reports/js/date-range-picker.js`: replaced dynamic import of `../../lib/enterprise-utils.js?v=...` with a static import; re-exported `getMinStartDate` so `reports-messaging.js` continues to import from the picker module.
- Eliminates runtime "Module not found in bundle" and build-time warnings.
- CI/CD
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: setup Node 20 and build the bundle before SFTP deploy; ensured `reports/dist` exists on target.
- Tests
- `tests/comprehensive_path_test.php`: updated references from `reports/js/reports-main.js` to `reports/js/reports-ui.js`.
- Single bundle removes fragile runtime module pathing (e.g., accidental `reports/reports/js/...`) and reduces 404 risk.
- Clearer naming avoids confusion between source module and dist artifact.
- Local build succeeds; bundle generated: `reports/dist/reports.bundle.js`.
- Reports page loads with no console errors; widgets initialize and update as expected.
- Low. Only filename references and JS loading strategy changed; server-side untouched.
## v3.9 (2025-09-17 16:45:00) — Remove Unused Assets (cleanup)
- Removed two unused assets identified via repo-wide reference search.
- [FIX] Deleted `lib/message- [FIX]dismissal- [FIX]fix.js` (no references; canonical file is `lib/message- [FIX]dismissal.js`).
- Deleted `messages/loading-message.css` (no code references; canonical file is `css/loading-message.css`).
- Reduce maintenance surface and avoid confusion from near-duplicate utilities and duplicated CSS placement.
- Grep search confirmed zero references before deletion.
- Test suite still passes; reports page and settings continue to load `lib/message-dismissal.js` and `../lib/print-utils.js` as expected.
## v2.10 (2025-09-17 17:10:00) — Deploy Workflow Hardening & CI Artifacts
- [PERF] Reduced deploy size and risk: filtered artifacts, deterministic health check, and no production sourcemaps.
- [ADD] `deploy- [ADD]config.json`: added `public_base_url` (now set to `https://webaim.org/training/online`).
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:
- CI build drops `--sourcemap` for the reports bundle.
- [ADD] Added rsync- [ADD]based artifacts step excluding dev- [ADD]only paths (`.git/`, `node_modules/`, `tests/`, `cache/`, `**/*.log`).
- SFTP deploy uses `./artifacts` as source.
- Health check URL built from `public_base_url/target_folder` (no brittle path slicing).
- [FIX] `lib/websocket- [FIX]console- [FIX]include.php`: compute page- [FIX]depth prefix so `lib/websocket- [FIX]console- [FIX]bridge.js` loads from any page.
- Smaller, faster uploads; avoids deploying unnecessary dev assets.
- More reliable health checks across environments.
- Robust script includes from nested paths.
- Lints clean for modified workflow.
- Local tests pass; reports bundle builds locally with sourcemaps; CI builds without sourcemaps.

- [ADD] `reports/css/reports- [ADD]data.css`: Added `.disabled- [ADD]option` styling for disabled cohort mode radio button
- [ADD] `test_cohort_disable.html`: Created test file to verify cohort mode disable functionality
- When date range is set to "ALL" (from min start date to today), the "count registrations by cohort(s)" option is automatically disabled
- [PERF] Visual feedback shows disabled state with reduced opacity and "not- [PERF]allowed" cursor
- If cohort mode is currently selected when switching to "ALL" range, it automatically switches to date mode
- Modified status message shows "Showing data for all registrations submitted in date range - count by cohorts disabled" when cohort mode is unavailable
- Works with both manual date input changes and preset radio button selections
- Prevents data discrepancies that could occur when using cohort filtering with all-time data
- Provides clear user feedback about why the option is unavailable
- Maintains data integrity by ensuring appropriate filtering methods are used for different date ranges
- [ADD] Test file created to verify functionality with different date range scenarios
- CSS styling provides clear visual indication of disabled state
