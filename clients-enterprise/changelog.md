- **File Permissions**: Automatically sets proper ownership (www-data) and permissions (644 for files, 755 for directories)
- **Gitignore Update**: Uncommented `.github/workflows/*` to allow workflow files in version control
- **Project Rules Optimization**: Completely restructured project rules for better AI agent comprehension and action
- **Git Bash Standard**: Updated rules to emphasize Git Bash as the default terminal for all operations

## 2025-07-15 16:26:08
- **New Report Pages Created**: Added `registrants.php` and `enrollees.php` based on `certificates.php` structure
- **File Renaming**: Renamed `certificates.php` → `certificates-earned.php`, `registrations.php` → `registrants.php`, `enrollments.php` → `enrollees.php`
- **Column Structure Updates**: Removed "Issued" column and added "Invited" as first column in both new reports
- **Data Filtering Logic**: 
  - Registrants report shows all registrations in date range (filters by Invited date)
  - Enrollees report shows only enrolled participants in date range (filters by Invited date AND Enrolled = "Yes")
- **Column Index Corrections**: Fixed column indices to match actual data structure (Invited at index 1, Enrolled at index 2)
- **Systemwide Data Links**: Added three report links to Systemwide Data section footer:
  - "Registrants Report" (under Registrations column)
  - "Enrollees Report" (under Enrollments column) 
  - "Cert Earners Report" (under Certificates column, shortened from "Certificate Earners Report")
- **JavaScript Updates**: Updated `date-range-picker.js` to handle all three report links with dynamic URL generation
- **DRY Implementation**: Applied identical HTML structure and CSS styling across all three report tables:
  - All tables use `id="certificate-data"` and `id="print-certificates-list"`
  - Moved "Invited" column to last position (same as "Issued" in certificates)
  - Identical column widths: Cohort (8%), Year (5%), First (10%), Last (12%), Email (31%), Organization (24%), Invited (10%)
  - Same text alignment and font sizing across all tables
- **CSS Consolidation**: Removed duplicate CSS rules for separate table IDs, ensuring single source of truth
- **Print Styling**: Applied identical print CSS rules to all three report tables
- **Caption Updates**: Updated table captions to "Registrants", "Enrollees", and "Certificate Earners" while preserving date range information
- **Title Updates**: Updated page titles to match new naming convention

## 2025-07-15 15:52:36
- **Development Server Started:** PHP development server started on localhost:8000 for local development and testing
- **Server Status:** Server running successfully with PHP 8.4.6 Development Server
- **No Code Changes:** No application code, configuration, or documentation files were modified during this session
- **Environment:** Development environment ready for testing and development work

## 2025-07-15 11:50:04
- **Repository Reset:** Removed all previous git history and created a new initial commit for a clean start.
- **.gitignore Review:** Verified that sensitive files, cache, logs, local configs, and development artifacts are properly excluded from version control. No major additions needed; file is comprehensive.
- **Changelog Policy:** Confirmed that `changelog.md` and `clients-enterprise/changelog.md` should remain in the repository for transparency and project history.
- **No Code Changes:** No application code or configuration files were modified during this process.

## 2025-07-10 12:08:45
- **Code Cleanup:** Removed disabled cache refresh code from reports page (reports/index.php)
- **Documentation Cleanup:** Deleted remove-refresh-report.md documentation file after confirming no refresh code remnants remain
- **Verification:** Confirmed reports page is clean of all refresh-related code including EnterpriseCacheManager, cache TTL checks, and output buffering logic
- **Impact:** No functional changes - refresh code was already disabled and non-functional, other refresh mechanisms (dashboard, admin) remain intact
- **Files Changed:**
  - `reports/index.php` (refresh code already removed in previous session)
  - `remove-refresh-report.md` (deleted - no longer needed)

## 2025-07-10 11:23:04
- **Project Structure Update:** Updated project rules to reflect working directory change from "clients-enterprise" to "otter" (root level)
- **Server Management:** Updated Local Server Management section to specify starting server from `otter/` directory instead of `clients-enterprise/`
- **Testing Requirements:** Updated testing location requirements to use root level `otter/` directory
- **Impact:** All development and testing procedures now correctly reference the root-level working directory

## 2025-07-09 11:19:27
- Fixed: Organizations filter input's datalist now dynamically updates after data display options are applied, ensuring the filter always reflects the currently visible rows.
- Enhancement: Data display and filter tools now work together seamlessly—filter input and datalist remain in sync with table state, preventing user confusion and tool conflicts.
- Implementation: Added calls to update the datalist in data display logic, both when the table is rebuilt and when no rows are shown.

## 2025-07-07 17:22:00 - Login Error Message Dismissal Fix for Production

- **Issue Fixed:**
  - Password error message on the login page was not dismissing when the user typed in the Password field on the production server, even though it worked locally.
- **Root Cause:**
  - The message dismissal JavaScript relied on detecting the current page using `window.location.pathname`.
  - On production, the path included additional directories (e.g., `/training/online/otter/login.php`), causing the script to fail to match `'login.php'` in its internal map, so no event listener was attached to the password field.
- **Solution:**
  - Updated the `getCurrentPage()` function in `lib/message-dismissal.js` to always return just the filename (e.g., `'login.php'`), regardless of the directory structure.
  - Added debug logging to help diagnose any future issues with page detection or event listener attachment.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Now, both local and production environments will correctly detect `'login.php'` and attach the error dismissal event listener to the password field.
  - This ensures the error message disappears as soon as the user types in the Password field, as intended.
- **Files Changed:**
  - `lib/message-dismissal.js` (enhanced page detection logic and debug logging)
  - `tests/login_message_dismissal_test.php` (diagnostic test page for message dismissal)
