- **Hardcoded Column Indices Implementation:** Updated all code to use hardcoded Google Sheets column indices instead of configuration-based dynamic loading
- **DataProcessor Refactoring:** Removed `getColumnIndex` method and updated all processing methods to use hardcoded indices directly:
  - `processInvitationsData`: Uses indices 1, 2, 10, 11 for Invited, Enrolled, Certificate, Issued columns
  - `processRegistrationsData`: Uses index 15 for Submitted column
  - `processEnrollmentsData`: Uses index 15 for Submitted column
  - `processSubmissionsData`: Uses index 15 for Submitted column
  - `processOrganizationData`: Uses index 9 for Organization column
- **OrganizationsAPI Refactoring:** Updated `getColumnIndex` method to use hardcoded indices mapping instead of configuration loading:
  - Added comprehensive mapping for all 17 columns (A-Q) with proper Google Sheets column references
  - Eliminated dependency on `UnifiedEnterpriseConfig::getGoogleSheets()` for column indices
- **Test Updates:** Fixed `reports_tables_validation_test.php` to reflect new hardcoded indices approach:
  - Updated method references from `processRegistrantsData` to `processInvitationsData`
  - Removed assertions for configuration-based column index methods
  - Updated debug test to use hardcoded index 15 for Submitted column
- **Code Consistency:** Ensured all Google Sheets data processing uses the same hardcoded index approach for reliability
- **Best Practice Implementation:** Hardcoded indices are now the default approach, eliminating configuration loading failures
- **Files Modified:**
  - `lib/data_processor.php` - Removed getColumnIndex method, updated all processing methods
  - `lib/api/organizations_api.php` - Updated getColumnIndex to use hardcoded mapping

## 2025-07-15 16:26:08
- **New Report Pages Created**: Added `registrants.php` and `enrollees.php` based on `certificates.php` structure
- **File Renaming**: Renamed `certificates.php` → `certificates-earned.php`, `registrations.php` → `registrants.php`, `enrollments.php` → `enrollees.php`
- **Column Structure Updates**: Removed "Issued" column and added "Invited" as first column in both new reports
- **Data Filtering Logic**: 
  - Registrants report shows all registrations in date range (filters by Invited date)
  - Enrollees report shows only enrolled participants in date range (filters by Invited date AND Enrolled = "Yes")
- **Column Index Corrections**: Fixed column indices to match actual data structure (Invited at index 1, Enrolled at index 2)
- **Systemwide Data Links**: Added three report links to Systemwide Data section footer:
  - "Registrants Report" (under Registrations column)
  - "Enrollees Report" (under Enrollments column) 
  - "Cert Earners Report" (under Certificates column, shortened from "Certificate Earners Report")
- **JavaScript Updates**: Updated `date-range-picker.js` to handle all three report links with dynamic URL generation
- **DRY Implementation**: Applied identical HTML structure and CSS styling across all three report tables:
  - All tables use `id="certificate-data"` and `id="print-certificates-list"`
  - Moved "Invited" column to last position (same as "Issued" in certificates)
  - Identical column widths: Cohort (8%), Year (5%), First (10%), Last (12%), Email (31%), Organization (24%), Invited (10%)
  - Same text alignment and font sizing across all tables
- **CSS Consolidation**: Removed duplicate CSS rules for separate table IDs, ensuring single source of truth
- **Print Styling**: Applied identical print CSS rules to all three report tables
- **Caption Updates**: Updated table captions to "Registrants", "Enrollees", and "Certificate Earners" while preserving date range information
- **Title Updates**: Updated page titles to match new naming convention

## 2025-07-09 11:19:27
- Fixed: Organizations filter input's datalist now dynamically updates after data display options are applied, ensuring the filter always reflects the currently visible rows.
- Enhancement: Data display and filter tools now work together seamlessly—filter input and datalist remain in sync with table state, preventing user confusion and tool conflicts.
- Implementation: Added calls to update the datalist in data display logic, both when the table is rebuilt and when no rows are shown.

## 2025-07-07 17:22:00 - Login Error Message Dismissal Fix for Production

- **Issue Fixed:**
  - Password error message on the login page was not dismissing when the user typed in the Password field on the production server, even though it worked locally.
- **Root Cause:**
  - The message dismissal JavaScript relied on detecting the current page using `window.location.pathname`.
  - On production, the path included additional directories (e.g., `/training/online/otter/login.php`), causing the script to fail to match `'login.php'` in its internal map, so no event listener was attached to the password field.
- **Solution:**
  - Updated the `getCurrentPage()` function in `lib/message-dismissal.js` to always return just the filename (e.g., `'login.php'`), regardless of the directory structure.
  - Added debug logging to help diagnose any future issues with page detection or event listener attachment.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Now, both local and production environments will correctly detect `'login.php'` and attach the error dismissal event listener to the password field.
  - This ensures the error message disappears as soon as the user types in the Password field, as intended.
- **Files Changed:**
  - `lib/message-dismissal.js` (enhanced page detection logic and debug logging)
  - `tests/login_message_dismissal_test.php` (diagnostic test page for message dismissal)
