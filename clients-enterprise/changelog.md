## 2025-07-18 14:35:00 - Unified refresh data logic

### Fixed
- **Admin page HTML structure corruption**: Resolved BOM character issue that was causing `<title>` and CSS links to appear inside `<body>` tag during manual refresh
- **Manual refresh functionality**: Restored admin manual refresh capability while maintaining clean HTML output
- **Output buffering**: Implemented proper output buffering during refresh process to prevent HTML corruption

### Technical Details
- **Root cause**: Manual refresh via POST request was generating BOM character, corrupting HTML structure
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive output buffering with `ob_clean()` before and after refresh process
- **Approach**: Maintained both automatic refresh (3-hour TTL) and manual refresh (0 TTL) for admin flexibility
- **Testing**: Verified no visual jump or HTML structure corruption during manual refresh

### Impact
- Admins can now manually refresh data before generating reports without HTML corruption
- Clean HTML structure maintained throughout refresh process
- CSS and JavaScript load properly in all scenarios
- Consistent behavior between dashboard (automatic) and admin (manual + automatic) refresh

## 2025-07-16 15:57:11
- **Update: Registrations and Enrollments Logic**
  - **Registrations**: Now defined strictly as rows from the Google Sheets “submissions” sheet, using the hardcoded “Submitted” column (index 15). All registration counts and reports are based on this canonical source, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
  - **Enrollments**: Now defined as a subset of Registrations—specifically, only those rows where the “Enrolled” column (index 2) is “Yes”. Enrollment data is generated from the Registrants sheet but filtered to match the canonical registration set.
  - **Cache Generation**: Separate cache files for registrations, enrollments, and certificates are generated using these new definitions, ensuring each report/table uses the correct, consistent data source.
  - **Systemwide and Organization Tables**: Both now use the new cache logic, so counts for Registrations and Enrollments are always in sync and based on the same underlying data.
  - **No More Filtering Raw Data**: All filtering and counting now operate on pre-processed, validated, and trimmed cache data, not on raw Google Sheets rows.
- **Impact:**
  - Eliminates discrepancies between Systemwide and Enrollees tables.
  - Ensures all registration/enrollment counts are accurate, consistent, and based on a single source of truth.
  - Simplifies maintenance and future enhancements.

  - `processEnrollmentsData`: Uses index 15 for Submitted column
  - `processSubmissionsData`: Uses index 15 for Submitted column
  - `processOrganizationData`: Uses index 9 for Organization column
- **OrganizationsAPI Refactoring:** Updated `getColumnIndex` method to use hardcoded indices mapping instead of configuration loading:
  - Added comprehensive mapping for all 17 columns (A-Q) with proper Google Sheets column references
  - Eliminated dependency on `UnifiedEnterpriseConfig::getGoogleSheets()` for column indices
- **Test Updates:** Fixed `reports_tables_validation_test.php` to reflect new hardcoded indices approach:

- **Systemwide Data Links**: Added three report links to Systemwide Data section footer:
  - "Registrants Report" (under Registrations column)
  - "Enrollees Report" (under Enrollments column)

- **JavaScript Updates**: Updated `date-range-picker.js` to handle all three report links with dynamic URL generation

## 2025-07-09 11:19:27
- Fixed: Organizations filter input's datalist now dynamically updates after data display options are applied, ensuring the filter always reflects the currently visible rows.
- Enhancement: Data display and filter tools now work together seamlessly—filter input and datalist remain in sync with table state, preventing user confusion and tool conflicts.
- Implementation: Added calls to update the datalist in data display logic, both when the table is rebuilt and when no rows are shown.

## 2025-07-07 17:22:00 - Login Error Message Dismissal Fix for Production

- **Issue Fixed:**
  - Password error message on the login page was not dismissing when the user typed in the Password field on the production server, even though it worked locally.
- **Root Cause:**
  - The message dismissal JavaScript relied on detecting the current page using `window.location.pathname`.
  - On production, the path included additional directories (e.g., `/training/online/otter/login.php`), causing the script to fail to match `'login.php'` in its internal map, so no event listener was attached to the password field.
- **Solution:**
  - Updated the `getCurrentPage()` function in `lib/message-dismissal.js` to always return just the filename (e.g., `'login.php'`), regardless of the directory structure.
  - Added debug logging to help diagnose any future issues with page detection or event listener attachment.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Now, both local and production environments will correctly detect `'login.php'` and attach the error dismissal event listener to the password field.
  - This ensures the error message disappears as soon as the user types in the Password field, as intended.
- **Files Changed:**
  - `lib/message-dismissal.js` (enhanced page detection logic and debug logging)
  - `tests/login_message_dismissal_test.php` (diagnostic test page for message dismissal)
