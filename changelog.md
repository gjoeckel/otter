# MVP System Changelog

This changelog tracks the development and evolution of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) system - a simplified, streamlined approach to the reports functionality that eliminates complexity while maintaining core features.

## v1.2.4 (2025-09-25 23:07:00) — Multi-Enterprise Organization Fix with Demo Mirrors

**Commit:** `cc28fef` | **Files:** 3 changed (+3563/-1992) | **Branch:** `mvp`

### 🔧 **FIX: Multi-Enterprise Organization Dashboard Access**

**Problem Solved:**
- Organizations with multiple enterprises (e.g., `["ccc", "demo"]`, `["csu", "demo"]`) were breaking dashboard pages when accessed directly with just a password
- Direct user access (e.g., `?org=8470`) had no enterprise context, causing `getEnterpriseByPassword()` to default to 'demo' for all multi-enterprise orgs

**Solution Implemented:**
- **[DEMO MIRRORS] Created 219 demo mirror organizations with unique passwords**
  - Original: `Bakersfield College (6435)` → `["ccc"]`
  - Demo Mirror: `Bakersfield College Demo (6436)` → `["demo"]`
- **[ENTERPRISE CLEANUP] Removed 'demo' from original multi-enterprise organizations**
  - CCC organizations now only have `["ccc"]`
  - CSU organizations now only have `["csu"]`
- **[LOGIC SIMPLIFICATION] Updated `getEnterpriseByPassword()` to prioritize 'demo' when present**

**Files Modified:**
- `config/passwords.json`: Added 219 demo mirror organizations, cleaned up enterprise assignments
- `lib/unified_database.php`: Simplified multi-enterprise logic

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ **CCC Organization**: `6435` (Bakersfield College) loads CCC data correctly
- ✅ **Demo Mirror**: `6436` (Bakersfield College Demo) loads demo data correctly  
- ✅ **CSU Organization**: `8470` (Bakersfield CSU) loads CSU data correctly

**Benefits:**
- Clear enterprise separation with no ambiguity about which enterprise data to show
- Dedicated demo organizations for testing without affecting real data
- Direct password access now works correctly for all organization types
- Simplified enterprise logic reduces complexity and potential bugs

## v1.2.3 (2025-01-27 19:00:00) — Enhanced Focus Indicators and CSS Styling Improvements
**Commit:** `09f1c77` | **Files:** 3 changed (+139/-9) | **Branch:** `mvp`

### 🎨 **STYLING: Enhanced Focus Indicators and Interactive Element Styling**

- **[ACCESSIBILITY] Improved focus indicators for all interactive elements** - Consistent golden focus styling across the entire interface
  - **Date Input Fields**: Added focus/hover styles with `3px solid #FFD700` outline and `2px offset`
  - **Radio Buttons**: Implemented circular golden focus indicators using `::after` pseudo-elements
  - **Applied to**: Date Range Picker, Organization Table, Groups Table, Systemwide Table, and Enrollments Table

- **[CSS PATTERN] Adopted table-toggle-button styling pattern** - Reused existing codebase patterns for consistency
  - **Radio Button Focus**: Uses `::after` pseudo-element with `position: absolute` and smooth transitions
  - **Positioning**: Fine-tuned positioning for perfect alignment (`top: -7px, left: -7px` for date picker, `top: -5px, left: -5px` for table widgets)
  - **Shape-Appropriate**: Circular outlines for radio buttons, rectangular outlines for other elements

- **[VISUAL CONSISTENCY] Unified interaction feedback** - All interactive elements now provide consistent visual feedback
  - **Color Scheme**: Consistent `#FFD700` (Gold) for all focus/hover states
  - **Animation**: Smooth `0.2s` transitions for all interactive elements
  - **Accessibility**: Clear visual feedback without interfering with functionality

### 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS**

- **CSS Architecture**: Reused existing patterns from `table-toggle-button` for maintainability
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Used `outline` and `box-shadow` techniques for consistent rendering
- **Performance**: Efficient pseudo-element approach with `pointer-events: none` to prevent interference

## v1.2.2 (2025-01-27 18:30:00) — Cohort Dropdown Removal and Enrollment Options Integration
